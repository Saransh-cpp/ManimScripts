Generating animation for the motion of 4th dimensional shapes, mobius strip and creating analogies between different dimensions. The code also brings the Carl Sagan's famous explaination of the 4th dimension to life via Computer Graphics.

## Requirements to run the code

1. Python 3.6 - see https://github.com/3b1b/manim/issues/1349
2. Pycairo related to the version of python you have
3. MikTex
4. FFmpeg
5. Sox
6. Manim library

## Minor details

- The final report with all the animations is available here.
- The black images in the final report are animations that won't work in the PDF format.
- The complete code is available under a single file.
- The code has been divided into multiple functions to increase readability.
- The files are not well arranged, I will definitelt group them in folders in the future.
